# Example Projects

A collection of example programs, written in Gren.

## hello\_world

Traditionally the first program one creates in any language, here implemented as a browser application. This represents the simplest browser-based Gren application you can make, and serves as a nice test to see if you've got Gren setup properly on your machine.

## 7GUIs

7GUIs is a set of small tasks, suitable for demonstrating how common GUI patterns can be implemented in a specific framework. The following folders implement the solutions to the [https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks](7GUIs) tasks:

* counter
* __todo__

## files

This program shows how you can make use of `gren-lang/files` for downloading and uploading files from a browser-based Gren program.
